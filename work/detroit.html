                <p>I have implemented a camera with the same functionalities that the Autodesk Maya one, and it's already released on production. The camera can rotate around a picked object, change the target and turn on itself. I have used matrix operations and raycasts to do this task.</p>
                <p>I have also worked on some new nodes on the animation system related to character locomotion. I have used quaternion operations for this task. Finally, I have created a prototype related to the future game of Quantic Dream. I have implemented a drone manager and drone behaviors. I have used an AI pathfinding, a state machine and matrix operations. During this internship I worked closely to the game designers. </p>

                    <p>Angéline helped me improve the animation system related to character locomotion. She produced very good features, immediately usable in the final product.</p><br>
                    <p>Always willing to give the best result, she is also a very kind person to work with. Last but not least, she is also eager to learn, aiming at developing her skills in a lot of domains.
                    Definitely a great asset to have on a project.</p><br>
