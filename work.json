This game was developed in C with a library GUI named AntTweakBar. I tried to get closer the MVC design pattern to this game by taking into account the constraints of C language. In this game, we have many objects, attributes and behavior which are managed with maths in 2D for the monsters and the towers."

You have the choice between 3 ambiances like country, or mountain. For the moment you can choose 4 cars. This game was developed by a team of 6 people in 3 weeks. I have also implemented the physics interactions between every component using the physic library Bullet. The rendering engine has been done with OpenGL 3. The main difficulty we faced was to create a spherical world. Why a sperical world ? Because we thought it was cool and it was a challenge for us."
